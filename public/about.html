<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Maria, I'm Brazilian and I live in Sweden.
  In Brazil, I worked with accounting for 7 years, but I always liked Programming, so I decided to study to finally start working with Software Technology.</p>

<p>I'm taking 3 courses focused on Programming, and I'm also specializing in Software Development.
  I have a long road ahead of me, but I know it will be rewarding!</p>

  <p>Thank you for coming here and meeting me!</p>
